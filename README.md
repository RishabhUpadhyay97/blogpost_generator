## Prompt Engineering Approach

Our approach to prompt engineering focuses on creating structured, context-rich prompts that guide the AI in generating high-quality, relevant content. Key aspects include:

1. **Dynamic Prompt Construction**: Prompts are dynamically generated based on user inputs, incorporating specific instructions for topic, style, audience, and format.

2. **Contextual Guidance**: Each prompt includes clear guidelines on content structure, encouraging the AI to create well-organized blog posts with introductions, body paragraphs, and conclusions.

3. **Specificity in Instructions**: Prompts include specific requirements such as using appropriate language for the target audience and incorporating relevant examples.

4. **Format Directives**: Instructions for using HTML headings and proper formatting are included to ensure structured output.

5. **Iterative Refinement**: The system uses a two-step process - initial generation followed by AI-assisted revision based on quality assessment.
